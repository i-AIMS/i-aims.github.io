bio: >
  I’m a computer scientist working with MRI analysis in MS for the last two decades, with a focus on figuring out how to translate and/or adapt research endpoints into clinical practice. While I’m cautious about AI, I’m also extremely excited about its potential to change the way we work with images and our ability to integrate with multi-modal data.

bio: >
  I’m a computational neuroscientist with a strong interest of a better understanding disease progression in Multiple Sclerosis by applying artificial intelligence tools to structural, functional, and diffusion-based neuroimaging and clinical data. I'm also passionate to leverage these tools to better understand the impact of menopause and pregnancy-related hormonal changes on disease in women with Multiple Sclerosis.

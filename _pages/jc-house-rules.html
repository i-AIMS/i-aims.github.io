        <h2>📘 Come prepared if possible</h2>
            Read the paper • Bring a question or takeaway

        <h2>⏰ Respect Time</h2>
            Be punctual • Keep comments concise

        <h2>📷 Cameras On (When You Can)</h2>
            Having cameras on makes discussion more engaging and interactive • If you need to turn yours off briefly, that’s totally okay

        <h2>🤝 Be Kind & Curious</h2>
            Listen actively and avoid interrupting • Critique ideas, not people

        <h2>🗣 Share the Floor</h2>
            Meetings via Microsoft Teams platform • Use the Raise Hand feature before speaking
            Moderator tracks raised hands and gives the floor • One mic at a time

        <h2>🎯 Stay (mostly) on topic</h2>
            Aim to connect comments to the paper’s goals, methods, results, or impact

        <h2>🙋 Ask questions generously</h2>
            No question is too basic • Questions are for learning, not testing
